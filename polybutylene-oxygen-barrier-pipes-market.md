<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polybutylene Oxygen Barrier Pipes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polybutene-1 Homopolymer (PB-H)</li><li>Polybutene-1 Random Copolymer (PB-R)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polybutylene Oxygen Barrier Pipes are categorized into two main types: Polybutene-1 homopolymer (PB-H) and Polybutene-1 random copolymer (PB-R). PB-H pipes are made from a single type of polybutene-1 molecule, resulting in a more uniform structure and higher strength. On the other hand, PB-R pipes are made from a combination of polybutene-1 molecules and other materials, offering a balance of flexibility and strength. Both types of pipes have oxygen barrier properties, making them suitable for use in heating and plumbing systems.</p></p>
