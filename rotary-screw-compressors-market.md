<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Screw Compressors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil-free</li><li>Oil-injected</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotary screw compressors can be classified into two main types: oil-free and oil-injected. Oil-free screw compressors do not require lubricating oil in the compression chamber, making them ideal for applications that require clean, oil-free air. On the other hand, oil-injected screw compressors use lubricating oil to seal and cool the compression chamber, making them more suitable for heavy-duty industrial applications. Both types of rotary screw compressors offer efficient and reliable air compression solutions for various industries.</p></p>
