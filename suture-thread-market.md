<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suture Thread Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Short-term Absorbable</li><li>Mid-term Absorbable</li><li>Long-term Absorbable</li><li>Non-Absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Suture thread market consists of four main types: Short-term Absorbable, Mid-term Absorbable, Long-term Absorbable, and Non-Absorbable. Short-term absorbable sutures are designed to be broken down by the body within a few weeks, making them suitable for internal stitches where healing is rapid. Mid-term absorbable sutures last slightly longer, typically being absorbed within 60-90 days. Long-term absorbable sutures take several months to be absorbed and are used for more prolonged healing. Non-absorbable sutures are made of materials that do not break down and are used for long-term wound closure.</p></p>
