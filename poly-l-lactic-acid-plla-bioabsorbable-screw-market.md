<p><h1>Poly L-lactic acid (PLLA) Bioabsorbable Screw Market Size, Market Share and Global Market Analysis Report, 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Poly L-lactic acid (PLLA) Bioabsorbable Screw Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Poly L-lactic acid (PLLA) bioabsorbable screws are innovative medical devices used in orthopedic surgeries for the fixation of bone fractures and osteotomies. These screws are gradually broken down and metabolized by the body over time, eliminating the need for a second surgery to remove them. </p><p>The Poly L-lactic acid (PLLA) Bioabsorbable Screw Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.4% during the forecast period. This growth is primarily driven by the increasing adoption of bioabsorbable implants in orthopedic surgeries due to their biocompatibility and reduced risk of postoperative complications. Additionally, advancements in material technology and manufacturing processes are leading to the development of enhanced bioabsorbable screws with improved mechanical strength and handling characteristics.</p><p>Furthermore, the rising prevalence of orthopedic disorders, such as fractures and sports injuries, is fueling the demand for bioabsorbable screws as a viable alternative to traditional metal implants. The market is also witnessing a trend towards the use of bioabsorbable screws in minimally invasive procedures, which require smaller incisions and lead to faster recovery times for patients. Overall, the Poly L-lactic acid (PLLA) Bioabsorbable Screw Market is poised for significant growth in the coming years.</p></p>
