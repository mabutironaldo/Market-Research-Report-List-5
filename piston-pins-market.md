<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Piston Pins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-floating</li><li>Fully Floating</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Piston pins, also known as wrist pins, are crucial components in internal combustion engines that connect the piston to the connecting rod. In the market, there are three main types of piston pins: semi-floating, fully floating, and other specialized designs. Semi-floating pins have a fixed attachment to either the piston or connecting rod, while fully floating pins are free to move within both components. Other types of pins may include titanium or DLC-coated options for high-performance applications. Each type of piston pin offers unique benefits and usage scenarios based on specific engine requirements.</p></p>
