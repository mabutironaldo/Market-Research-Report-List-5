<p><strong>The Anticoccidial Drugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Antibiotic Anticoccidials</li><li>Ionophore Anticoccidials</li><li>Chemical Derivative Anticoccidials</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Anticoccidial drugs can be categorized into three main types: antibiotic, ionophore, and chemical derivative. Antibiotic anticoccidials work by inhibiting the growth of coccidia in the intestines. Ionophore anticoccidials disrupt the ion balance within the coccidia, leading to their death. Chemical derivative anticoccidials are synthetic compounds that have been developed specifically to target and kill coccidia. Each type of anticoccidial drug works through different mechanisms to effectively control coccidiosis in livestock and poultry populations.</p></p>
