<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solids Samplers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automatic</li><li>Manual</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solids samplers are devices used to collect representative samples of solid materials for analysis. There are two main types of solids samplers: automatic and manual. Automatic samplers are programmed to collect samples at regular intervals without human intervention, making them ideal for continuous monitoring applications. Manual samplers, on the other hand, require an operator to physically collect samples, making them suitable for smaller-scale or less frequent sampling needs. Both types of samplers play a crucial role in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of analytical data.</p></p>
