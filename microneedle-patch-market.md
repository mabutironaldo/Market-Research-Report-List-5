<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microneedle Patch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dissolving Type</li><li>Insoluble Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Microneedle patches are a type of drug delivery system that comes in two main types: dissolving and insoluble. Dissolving microneedle patches are made of materials that dissolve in the skin, releasing the drug into the body. This type is often used for delivering vaccines or small molecule drugs. On the other hand, insoluble microneedle patches do not dissolve and instead remain in the skin after application. They are typically used for long-acting drug delivery or for delivering larger molecules like proteins or peptides.</p></p>
