<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gray Foam Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Cell</li><li>Open Cell</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gray foam glass is a versatile insulation material that comes in two main types: closed cell and open cell. Closed cell foam glass has a denser structure, with sealed air pockets that provide excellent thermal insulation properties. This type is commonly used in applications where moisture resistance is important. On the other hand, open cell foam glass has a more porous structure, making it lighter and more flexible. It is often used in areas where acoustic insulation or drainage properties are required.</p></p>
