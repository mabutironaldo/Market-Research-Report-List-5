<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Three-phase Rectifiers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Half-wave Rectification</li><li>Full-wave Rectification</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Three-phase rectifiers are used in power electronics to convert three-phase AC power into DC power. Half-wave rectification uses only one phase of the three-phase AC input to produce a pulsating DC output. Full-wave rectification uses all three phases of the input to produce a smoother DC output. The market for half-wave rectification is typically smaller and less efficient compared to full-wave rectification due to its limited use of the available input power.</p></p>
