<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Renal Dialysis Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hemodialysis</li><li>Peritoneal Dialysis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Renal Dialysis Equipment Market is divided into two main types: Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis. </p><p>Hemodialysis involves filtering the blood using an artificial kidney machine. It is the most common type of dialysis in which the blood is pumped out of the body, cleaned, and then returned through a dialyzer.</p><p>Peritoneal dialysis, on the other hand, uses the lining of the abdomen as a filter to remove waste products from the blood. It involves the use of a dialysis solution that is infused into the abdomen and then drained out after a period of time.</p></p>
