<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vascular Access Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anti-microbial Catheter</li><li>Non Anti-microbial Catheter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vascular access catheters are medical devices used for administering medication or fluids, obtaining blood samples, and hemodialysis. The market for these catheters is divided into two main types: anti-microbial catheters and non anti-microbial catheters. Anti-microbial catheters are designed to prevent infections by releasing antibiotics or other anti-microbial substances. Non anti-microbial catheters do not have this feature and are typically used in patients who do not have a high risk of infection. Both types of catheters play a crucial role in managing patients' vascular access needs.</p></p>
