<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heavy Truck Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tire</li><li>Bias Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Heavy truck tyre market comprises two main types: radial tyre and bias tyre. Radial tyres are constructed with plies running radially from the bead, providing better traction, fuel efficiency, and heat dispersion. Bias tyres, on the other hand, have plies running at alternating angles, making them more suitable for off-road and harsh terrain conditions. While radial tyres are preferred for long-haul transportation due to their durability, bias tyres are commonly used in agriculture and construction industries for their strength and resistance to punctures.</p></p>
