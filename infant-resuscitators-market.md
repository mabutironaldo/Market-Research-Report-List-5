<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infant Resuscitators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-inflating Resuscitator</li><li>Flow-inflating Resuscitator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Infant resuscitators are devices used to provide artificial ventilation to newborn infants in medical emergencies. There are two main types of infant resuscitators: self-inflating resuscitators and flow-inflating resuscitators. Self-inflating resuscitators have a bag that automatically inflates when squeezed, delivering a set amount of tidal volume to the patient. Flow-inflating resuscitators, on the other hand, rely on a gas flow to inflate the bag and provide ventilation. Both types of resuscitators are essential tools for healthcare providers in neonatal care.</p></p>
