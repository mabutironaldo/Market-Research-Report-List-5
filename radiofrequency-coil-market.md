<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiofrequency Coil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Volume Coils</li><li>Surface Coils</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiofrequency coils are essential components of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems, used to transmit and receive radiofrequency signals for imaging purposes. Volume coils are designed to provide uniform coverage of larger areas of the body, making them ideal for imaging the brain or abdomen. On the other hand, surface coils are smaller and provide higher resolution imaging of specific areas closer to the surface of the body, such as extremities or joints. Both types of coils are important for different imaging applications in the field of radiology.</p></p>
