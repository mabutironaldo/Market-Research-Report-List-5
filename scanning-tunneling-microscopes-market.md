<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Scanning Tunneling Microscopes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Constant-Current Mode</li><li>Constant-Height Mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Scanning Tunneling Microscopes (STMs) are used in two main modes: Constant-Current Mode and Constant-Height Mode. In Constant-Current Mode, the current between the tip and the sample is kept constant, allowing for precise measurement of the sample's surface topography. On the other hand, Constant-Height Mode maintains a fixed tip-sample distance, providing information about the sample's conductivity and magnetic properties. Both market types offer unique advantages for different types of research and applications in fields such as nanotechnology and materials science.</p></p>
