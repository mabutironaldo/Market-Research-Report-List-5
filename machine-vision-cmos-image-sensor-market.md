<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Machine Vision CMOS Image Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolling Shutter</li><li>Global Shutter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Machine Vision CMOS Image Sensor market can be divided into two primary types: Rolling Shutter and Global Shutter. Rolling Shutter sensors capture images by scanning each row of pixels sequentially, which can result in motion blur for fast-moving objects. Global Shutter sensors capture the entire image at the same time, eliminating motion blur. Rolling Shutter sensors are more cost-effective and widely used in applications where motion blur is not a concern, while Global Shutter sensors are preferred for high-speed imaging and applications requiring precise timing.</p></p>
